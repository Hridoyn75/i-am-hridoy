          Hey everybody, <br /> Where I live in Chicago, everybody is aware when
          Mexican Independence Day approaches. In fact, I mark it on my
          calendar. <br /> My neighbors fly green, white, and red flags from
          their porches, attach flags to their car hoods, and even rock
          color-coordinated Air Jordans to celebrate the work of Father Hidalgo
          back on September 16, 1810. The park districts hold parties, libraries
          highlight historical books, elementary schools hold productions, the
          city hosts an enormous parade — the whole shebang. For those
          unfamiliar with the Chi, it might be surprising to learn that the
          Second City’s second largest population is Latino and of those, the
          majority are Mexican-Americans or of Mexican ancestry. That Mexican
          Independence Day falls within the month-long U.S celebration of
          Hispanic Heritage Month is appropriate; <br /> <br />
          after all, it’s good for everyone to learn more about our shared
          humanity, and our hopes, values, and dreams. The month starts on
          September 15 to commemorate a variety of Latin American countries that
          celebrate their independence around that date, including Costa Rica,
          El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Chile. Back in 1988,
          former U.S. President Ronald Reagan facilitated turning Hispanic
          Heritage Week into Hispanic Heritage Month. Many writers on Medium
          embrace this idea of celebrating freedom while sharing stories and
          histories that interrogate — or explain — heritage and various levels
          of intersectionality. <br /> <br /> <br />
          Argentine-born writer and diversity and inclusion expert dani herrera
          writes of the debate over the use of Latine, Latinx, Latino or
          Hispanic. “Our community is as beautiful as it is expansive and
          diverse. And yes, every single one of these identities is valid.”
          Author María Ochoa PhD details how she feels about being an aging
          Chicana. At 72, she no longer hides her years. “I’m happy to be in
          this band of sisters, these aging American-Mexican women,” she writes,
          “these viejitas who value and revel in the process of growing old.”
          And author David Bowles, the creator of powerhouse Latinx book
          publishing initiative #DignidadLiteraria, often writes both fiction
          and nonfiction on his Medium page. <br /> Once, he addressed the idea
          of Mexican Futurism as a genre in science fiction and fantasy. I look
          forward to learning from those of you who share your own stories of
          heritage and identity on Medium. Perhaps this is a memory of the old
          country, or a tale proffered by great-great-grandma. Perhaps you’ve
          imagined a sci-fi future in a story that we all should be reading. Is
          that you? Feel free to tag me so I can read your stories. Also, shanah
          tovah umetukah to those who celebrate Rosh Hashanah. See you on
          Medium. Adrienne Gibbs Director of Creator Growth @ Medium Weekend
          Reads “How 9/11 Taught Me To Stop Saying ‘Everything Will Be Okay’” by
          Jay Sillings , emergency room physician I’m grateful for the crying
          woman’s clarity of mind in that moment of chaos and terror. She taught
          me the absurdity of “everything will be okay.” Even in less acute
          circumstances when that prediction may eventually be true, it’s at
          best a dismissive comment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
          Something we say to coddle our own discomfort with the emotions of
          whomever we’re talking with. Ultimately, it’s a missed opportunity to
          express empathy and genuine support. “Debunking the Myths Surrounding
          El Vejigante Puertorriqueño” by Lola Rosario , journalist and art
          enthusiast, in Ilusiones Among the many symbols representative of our
          rich cultural heritage, one of the most celebrated is without
          question, El Vejigante. Some say the term is derived from a
          combination of la vejiga (bladder) and el gigante (giant), the English
          equivalent would be Giant Bladder [Person]. Sounds awkward in
          translation, so we simply keep the original name. Image: La Comparsa,
          by Painter & Sculptor, Samuel Lind Hernández “Why It Doesn’t Really
          Matter What You Wear to Temple” by Rabbi Nikki DeBlosi (she/her) ,
          teacher, speaker, and rabbi Minhag hamakom, the custom of a place,
          does matter, and I understand that some Jewish institutions carry
          particular dress codes. But I am a Reform Jew, a feminist, a queer
          person, a parent, and a rabbi, and when it comes to how anyone
          “should” dress to observe the High Holy Days, there are values that
          matter much more to me than what’s “appropriate.” Like presence.{" "}
          <br /> <br />
          Like community. Like inclusion. Like belonging. “The New Wham! Film
          Speaks Loudly in Careful Whispers” by Tom Cendejas aka The Couch
          Tamale , film reviewer It’s been stirred in me, and I suspect many
          others by the new documentary “Wham!” on Netflix. Though “Wham!” stays
          focused only on the beginning-to-end of the titular pop duo, it
          doubles as George Michael’s “birth of the artist” origin story, and
          the bubbly joy of the film leaves an aftertaste of melancholy when the
          credits roll, because we know how the story ends. George Michael fans
          are always left in a state of “what might have been.” “A G20 Drama: No
          Agreement on Ending Fossil Fuels” by Enrique Dans , Professor of
          Innovation at IE Business School in Enrique Dans We must grasp this
          unequivocal truth: the choice is either to set a date for ending
          fossil fuels with all its implications or live in an increasingly
          destabilized world where hurricanes, tornadoes, heatwaves, and
          wildfires become more frequent, endangering our lives and property.
          It’s a sinister lottery with plenty of fools saying, “It won’t happen
          to me,” all while urging their governments not to turn off the tap of
          the foul-smelling liquid they use to artificially sustain their way of
          life. IMAGE: E. Dans (CC0) “No, Immigrants Don’t Get $2,200/Month” by
          Arturo Dominguez , freelance writer and journalist Their
          misinformation tactics are meant to distract from the fact that
          immigrants are huge contributors to our social programs. They pay into
          programs like Medicaid and Social Security but are often unqualified
          to receive them because of age and ineligibility. <br /> <br /> <br />{" "}

          bolster the positive financial outcome. Photo by Manny Becerra on
